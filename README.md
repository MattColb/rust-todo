## Rust ToDo Application

This is a basic command line application that I am using to learn rust. Currently, it allows you to create a todo list which allows you to add items and check them off. You are also able to save your sessions in txt files and restart your session at a later time.

Future Features
- Async function with a pomodoro timer.
- Ability to manage multiple todo lists in the same application session (i.e. for different projects).
- User login so that you don't have to input the file name where it is saved
- Change from txt to json or MySQL database.
- Potential GUI implementation.
- Tests to ensure that everything is working
